bio: `<h3>How did you first come to Red Cloud?</h3>
<p>I was born in San Diego; my mom, who is from the Navajo Nation, was in the Navy and my dad, who is Lakota, was in the Marines. When I was 4 or 5, we moved to South Dakota, and I went to first through fourth grade in Rapid City, and then we moved to the [Pine Ridge] reservation. I went to Our Lady of Lourdes (OLL), Red Cloud's sister school, for a year, but then my parents got divorced and&hellip;and I moved back and forth between South Dakota and New Mexico for a while.</p>
<p>There were a lot of difficult transitions at that time, especially with the divorce. But I came back to OLL for 6th grade, stayed through 8th grade, and then came to Red Cloud for all of high school. I feel more comfortable and confident now, being at Red Cloud. Looking back at being a freshman, and reflecting on that time, I can see the slow transition to the person I am now. And I'm pretty proud of that.</p>
<h3>What filled your days here, and what was important to you?</h3>
<p>Running cross country and track was really important to me, because it was time when I could reflect and de-stress.</p>
<p>And I opened myself up by joining student organizations, like the Spiritual Formation Team on campus. During my freshman year I tried to run for student council but was really disappointed when I did get it. I shared that with Garrrett [Gundlach S.J., a former staff member who helped to lead campus ministry services] and he suggested that I think about Spiritual Formation. I didn't really know what it was then, but it ended up being a highlight of my high school career. Without being a part of it, I wouldn't have gained the public speaking skills I did, or put myself out there more in the community.</p>
<h3>What or who at Red Cloud made a difference in your life?</h3>
<p>A lot of people made a difference, but some of the main people are my teacher Katie Montez, and Garrett. Looking back at my freshmen year, I didn't really have a great start in high school. I was shy and reserved, and that restricted me from going out and making friends. It was a lonely time. But I think going to Katie and to Garrett, talking to them about how I was feeling and trying to deal with the loneliness I was facing, really helped. If it wasn't for their encouragement and support, and my academics and extracurriculars, I don't think I'd be where I am now.</p>
<p>Katie also encouraged me to apply to be a part of the Native American Health Scholars Program , and that's another one of the highlights of my time here. That's how I've been able to go to the American Indian Science and Engineering Society conferences every year.  It was such a source of empowerment, seeing all these Native people &mdash; and especially Native women &mdash; doing their own research projects in different STEM fields.</p>
<h3>What impact did studying Lakota language have on you?</h3>
<p>In my childhood years, I learned Lakota from my grandma and grandpa. I wasn't fluent, but I could understand a lot. Once we started moving around more, I lost touch with that. So when I got to Red Cloud and began taking language classes, it was all brought back to me. I definitely plan to continue to learn, both Lakota and the Navajo language as well. I'll be attending Stanford in the fall, and they offer both&hellip;and I'm planning to take them.</p>
<h3>Talk about your plans for next year!</h3>
<p>While I was in middle school, my cousin Savannah was accepted to Stanford, and everyone in my family was talking about it. My mom told me it was in California, where I was born&hellip;and I told her, that's one of the schools I want to go to. If I get in, that's where I'm going. And it happened.</p>
<p>My academic advisor at Stanford is a Native woman, and it's really nice to know that I'll have the support of someone who understands my needs. That was certainly a factor of the colleges I decided to apply to, the support available to Native students. I read a lot about how Native students who go to predominantly white schools have a hard time finding support and fitting in, so I wanted that Native community.</p>
<p>How did the Red Cloud community support you in your path to college?
Without Red Cloud, I probably wouldn't have come this far. I had so many teachers double and triple check my essays, to make sure everything was perfect. And January Tobacco [Red Cloud's Director of Student Advancement and Alumni Support] is a Stanford alumni, and she looked over my entire application and provided so much help with the Stanford process. I'm so thankful for her.</p>
<h3>Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self?</h3>
<p>I would say to my younger self that your only competition is yourself. Everyone else is in their own race. If you're at times lonely, because everyone will be, you have to recognize that this whole time, you have yourself and that's where you have to find comfort.</p>`},

bio: `<h3>How did you first come to Red Cloud?</h3>
<P>I grew up in Pine Ridge and I've been at Red Cloud since preschool. I've never been at any other school. There are many people here I've known since I was 4, and so with graduation so close, I'm nervous because I'm not going to have all those people who've been with me for so long. But I'm also excited, because it will be a whole different journey and experience.</P>
<h3>What or who at Red Cloud made a difference in your life?</h3>
<p>In middle school, my teacher Gretchen made a huge impression on me. She was always focused on me, and she had such a spark for life. She was also the first one to get me interested in science, which is what I want to study and go into in the future. I also look up to Katie Montez, my high school science teacher. I love how comfortable she is with herself and how confident, especially in science. Everything in our biology class is just so interesting. It's what I wrote about in my college essays &mdash; it's the study of life, and you can go into so many different fields with it.</p>
<p>From the moment I was born, I've always thought 'we need to take care of Unci Maka [or Mother Earth]'. It's always been one of the main things I'm interested in. I'm not exactly sure yet, but I really love working with animal and, if anything, I'll probably end up working with wildlife.</p>
<h3>What challenges have you overcome here at Red Cloud?</h3>
<p>My senior year has been one of the hardest years for me. One way I got through that was talking about it, and writing a lot. I'm not the best writer but I do like to write things down when I'm not feeling that great. I put a lot of thought into my essays for college, and that's really helped me.</p>
<p>I also had a strong support system. Abby, my AP literature teacher, is someone I really look up to and admire. She always cares how her students are doing, and makes sure they are doing well. She's been one of my biggest supports at Red Cloud.</p>
<h3>Talk about what you've accomplished, and your plans for next year!</h3>
<p>I'm very proud of my grades; I've been on national honors since sophomore year and I feel like that's an amazing thing. I'm also really proud of of our cheerleading team. Even though we didn't have the best seasons, it was such a good experience and our team had such a good bond. And I'm extremely proud that I got a full-ride scholarship to the University of Denver, where I'll be going in the fall!</p>
<p>How did the Red Cloud community support you in your path to college?
Since freshman year, our teachers have been instilling in us that we need to focus on our grades, and to prepare for the ACT. They've been preparing us to succeed. In our classes they go the extra mile, because they want us to be prepared for college. In my AP calculus and AP literature classes, they are really honest about how it will be next year.</p>
<h3>Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest things is to always listen in your Lakota studies class, because at the end of the day, that's your identity. All the way since preschool, I still remember all my Lakota studies classes, and they have always been the most important to me."</p>`},

bio: `<h3>How did you first come to Red Cloud?</h3>
<p>I've lived in Pine Ridge whole life and came to Red Cloud in 5th grade, and have been here ever since.</p>
<h3>What filled your days here, and what was important to you?</h3>
<p>I really loved the basketball program, and I've been a part of it since I was in 8th grade. I got hurt this year and wasn't able to play, but it was a big part of my life.</p>
<h3>What or who at Red Cloud made a difference in your life?</h3>
<p>I've made so many friends through the years, especially through basketball. And I'm still very close with my coaches, even though I wasn't able to play this season.</p>
<h3>What impact did studying Lakota language have on you?</h3>
<p>My grandma is fluent in Lakota, so I can understand it. But the Lakota Language Program here has really helped me with the talking part. It really helped me be more comfortable speaking it. Growing up, I understood what my grandmother was saying, but now I'm able to speak to her a little bit.</p>
<h3>Talk about your plans for next year!</h3>
<p>Ever since I was 10 years old, I've wanted to go into the military, so I'll be joining this summer. When I was little, I always pretended to be a paramedic, and always wanted to be a combat medic, and that's what I plan on pursuing.</p>
<h3>Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self?</h3>
<p>Staying active should be a priority! Keep your head on your shoulders, be your own person. Don't let other people be your happiness, be your own!</p>`},

bio: `<h3>Why was Red Cloud the right place for you?</h3>
<p>I've been at Red Cloud for five years, and for me, it's been the right place because of the language and culture. In Lakota culture, there are many sides, including dancing and ceremonies, and our unique history. I went to school off-reservation for along time, and I think that it's difficult in public schools to really fully put yourself out there, with your beliefs in spiritual practices like ours.</p>
<p>Here, I'm able to speak Lakota in the hallways with friends. It's become something that happens every day, and it's completely natural. That's what I like about Red Cloud. It provided the avenue for that to happen. The environment is really supportive, especially now, as we're moving more and more toward our culture and language.</p>
<p>What opportunities have been most important to you in these five years?
Red Cloud has a pretty well rounded education; it's not just focused on academics, or any one area. You develop all-around, and get exposed to things you wouldn't otherwise.</p>
<p>For a long time I felt like I didn't really have access to the world outside the reservation, that I wasn't going to have an avenue to be successful there. But I had the chance to go to the [South Dakota] School of Mines. Red Cloud showed me how many paths there are to take, and what we can do for the people here in our community, and the importance of that.</p>
<h3>What or who at Red Cloud made a difference in your life?</h3>
<p>For me, it's all the relationships that we built with each other. Last year our class lost a classmate to suicide, and it put a scar in all our hearts. It was really tough coming back to school after that. But we did come back together, and although we had lost someone so close to us, that experience gave me hope. We believe in each other, and that's where that hope comes from. Some of us come from really hard places, really hard families, but we've made the best with what it is, and supported each other through all of it. That's been amazing.</p>
<p>And for me personally, the relationship I've built with the Lakota language, because that I will carry that with me forever.</p>
<h3>Talk about your plans for the future?</h3>
<p>I'm still in the process of deciding. I've been accepted to the South Dakota School of Mines, but I think I may do the summer program, the Indian University of North America, at the Crazy Horse Memorial. I hope to attend the University of North Dakota's Lakota Language program, but first I need to have a two-year associate degree to qualify. So I plan to to take advantage of the education we have here on the reservation and take classes at Oglala Lakota College.</p>
<p>I definitely want to teach the Lakota language when I'm older. Especially for kids growing up on the reservation, we really do feel the effects of intergenerational trauma. But being able to speak in Lakota, and to share in community with other Lakota people, in the way that our ancestors did for such a long time &mdash; it's really powerful. That's where the Lakota people found their strength &mdash; in the family and community circle, that way of life. It's a spiritual path rather than just an academic one. But that's another reason that Red Cloud has helped; it incorporates both the spiritual and the academic into education.</p>
<h3>Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self?</h3>
<p>I would say, don't be afraid to open your heart to the world. Don't be afraid to reach out to the things that call you, to step out of the line and truly be yourself. There's a quote that says the farthest journey a person can take is from their head to their heard. And in a way, that's what Red Cloud is trying to do with its education, to let us open both our minds and hearts through learning.</p>`},

bio: `<h3>How did you first come to Red Cloud?</h3>
<p>I grew up on a ranch on the plains, out in the country. That's my sanctuary from all the negativity around the reservation, and it's still my home. I came to Red Cloud in the fall of 2015, when I started to get more into being a student. I was able to be more spiritual, to make more friends, and just to be more myself.</p>
<h3>What filled your days here, and what was important to you?</h3>
<p>Being able to speak in Lakota. When I was younger, my parents and grandparents would speak in Lakota. If I did something bad, they would yell at me in Lakota, and I would understand. But then when I came to Red Cloud, it enhanced my understanding. More gained more knowledge of the language, beyond what I just absorbed as a kid.</p>
<h3>What or who at Red Cloud made a difference in your life?</h3>
<p>At Red Cloud I was able to build relationships with a lot of people. Roger White Eyes, our Lakota language teacher, he was an outstanding teacher and still is.</p>
<h3>Talk about your plans for next year!</h3>
<p>I plan to go to Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts to study cultural anthropology. I want to learn more about the Lakota people, and and also about other tribes and the unique ways we communicated with other people, like through handgames.</p>
<h3>What would you like to do beyond college?</h3>
<p>I want to be a teacher, in high school or in college. With a degree in cultural anthropology, I'll be able to teach the history of the Lakota people. I'll be able to give knowledge to those who don't understand, or who never had the opportunity to learn. Decolonization is the main point. If you're mixed blood or full blood, it doesn't matter. If you're Lakota, you need to know your identity.</p>
<h3>Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self?</h3>
<p>I would say, don't be scared of the things that are going to come, because in reality there are always going to be people right behind you. If you are stuck, the best way forward is to pray and not look back. Don't look back until you've achieved your goal, when you can say &mdash; I made it through, not by myself but with the people who cared and who believed.</p>`},

bio: `<h3>How did you first come to Red Cloud?</h3>
<p>I grew up in Rocky Ford, about an hour away from Red Cloud. I attended another school my freshman year, and then came to Red Cloud for the last three years of high school.</p>
<h3>What filled your days here, and what was important to you?</h3>
<p>I'm very into sports, especially volleyball and basketball. Unfortunately, before basketball season this year I tore my ACL and had to sit out the whole season. Despite that, I have the best teammates ever, and we all just work so well together.</p>
<h3>What or who at Red Cloud made a difference in your life?</h3>
<p>I've really enjoyed the people that I see every day, and particularly the teachers have helped me to understand, and made it easy for me to learn. I love English and writing, and so Laree, my creative writing and journalism teacher, and Jac, our English teacher, have had a big impact.</p>
<h3>What's been the biggest challenge you've overcome?</h3>
<p>Waking up every morning! I live very far from campus, have to wake up very early to get here on time. But my last school was too easy, and I wanted a challenge. My older sister and my dad both went to Red Cloud, and my dad really wanted me to come here to get a good education.</p>
<h3>Talk about your plans for next year!</h3>
<p>I was lucky enough to sign with United Tribes Technical College to play basketball there! I'll start in general studies, but I'm really interested in studying psychology, and learning about the brain and how we think. I could imagine being a social worker or professor some day.</p>
<h3>Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self?</h3>
<p>Stay on top of your work, because it gets overwhelming when you fall behind, and more difficult to stay motivated.</p>`}]
